An E-Commerce App built in React for The Odin Project

This was the first major react project I made, utilizing various components and hooks. Different components were made for each individual page, and I used react routing to link between the different pages. I also used a transition library to apply a fade in animation for the cart. The cart handles various logic applications, such as adding, incrementing and decrementing, deleting, and submitting. I applied this logic by using .map(), .filter(), and .findIndex(). As well as different react states.
